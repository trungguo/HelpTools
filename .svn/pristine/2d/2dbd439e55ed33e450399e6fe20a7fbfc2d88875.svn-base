# textpad

A simple online notepad, no WYSIWYG, no fancy stuff, just write. The text will live in your browser until you decide to delete or download it as a .txt file.

### [Try it!](http://textpad.surge.sh)

## Why? 

Another browser text editor...I know, i know. Just because i can and want to!
 
1. I find myself copy/pasting alot of text online, copy proofing something i want to publish on social media/comment feeds, or paste inside html templates i'm building.
2. This little app also helps keep me focused when doing research online, taking notes without switching between a text editor and the browser.
3. Inspired by others, and i wanted to really build something using [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage).
